# HappyVibe — project context

Electron app shipping a curated distribution of the Pi coding agent (pinned, vendored)
with permission UX + context-window visibility as the differentiators.
PRD: docs/prd.md (mirror of the Notion PRD — fold decisions in place, NEVER rewrite wholesale).

## Commands
- `npm install && (cd pi-runtime && npm ci)` — BOTH installs required (pi-runtime is a separate vendored tree; fresh worktrees fail live tests without it)
- `npm run dev` · `npm test` · `npm run build`
- Typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.node.json` and `-p tsconfig.web.json`
- Full gate = both typechecks + non-live suite + live files batched + build

## Tests
- Live-Pi tests (real DeepSeek; `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `.env`, skipIf-gated):
  tests/{bridge,rules-bridge,intent-bridge,ask-user-bridge,agents-md-bridge,subagent-context,permission-coexistence,mcp-bridge}.test.ts
- Run live files BATCHED in one vitest invocation — they flake under the full parallel
  suite (process + LLM contention). One live failure ⇒ rerun in isolation before calling it a regression.
- Contract tests are the Pi upgrade gate: any pi/pi-subagents pin bump must pass them.
  Wire shapes are documented in docs/validation/d1.md — new bridge shapes go there too.

## Architecture (keep layer)
- src/main/pi/{spawn,codec,PiClient}.ts — spawns the pinned Pi CLI per session, `--mode rpc`,
  NDJSON over stdio. spawn.ts is electron-free (vitest-importable). We deliberately do NOT
  use Pi's in-process SDK: process isolation is load-bearing (crash isolation, hibernation).
- pi-runtime/ — vendored @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent + pi-subagents + pi-mcp-adapter (pinned exact)
  + extensions/ (happyvibe-bridge.ts + pure hv-*.ts modules shared with main and tests).
- The bridge owns ALL permission UI/enforcement (Pi's permission pkg is TUI-only in RPC —
  docs/validation/v6.md). Permission prompts never auto-allow and never time out.
- Bridge⇄main protocol: JSON envelopes `kind:"hv.*"` over extension_ui_request
  (blocking = select/input; fire-and-forget = notify); bridge slash-commands `/hv-*` via RPC prompt.
- JSONL EventLog, frozen envelope `{ts,type,sessionId?,workspaceId?,data?}` — audit + analytics. No SQLite.
- Model resolution: session → workspace → global, mirrored in ipc.ts `spawnOpts` AND
  renderer composer.ts `resolveModel` — change both or neither.

## Gotchas
- One-shot pi CLI calls hang unless stdin is closed (`stdio: ["ignore", …]`). RPC mode unaffected.
- Built-in Pi tools cannot take extra schema params (stripped before tool_call) — `intent`
  goes on registered tools only; built-ins get derived labels (toolLabel.ts / describeCommand.ts).
- Pi has NO dequeue RPC; abort preserves the queue.
- Context removal: completed turns only (removing the in-flight pair causes a runaway
  re-execution loop); toolCall/toolResult always removed atomically.
- `contextUsage.tokens` is null right after compaction; `stats.tokens` is cumulative-since-
  session-start — never present it as live context (gauge shows "measuring…").
- pi-subagents children need `PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY` (set in spawn.ts). Packaged app has no
  standalone `node` for its shebang — open distribution item.
- Every fs writer must be path-confined (pattern: agentsMd.ts / files.ts `resolveInWorkspace`).
- Workspace paths are normalized inside WorkspaceRegistry — never compare raw path strings.
- Renderer perf invariants: streaming text stays OUT of the transcripts array
  (streamRef + rAF batching in App.tsx); tool cards update via the toolIndex map, never a full .map().
- MCP: the adapter's proxy tool is `mcp`; the bridge unwraps it (hv-mcp.ts) to a virtual rule name `mcp:<serverKey>_<toolName>` (e.g. `mcp:github_create_issue`) for rules/grants/prompts/audit; discovery calls (search/describe/connect) are safe-default-allowed. Config read at session start — changes need a new session. stdio servers configured with `node`/`npx` need a runtime in the packaged app (same class as the pi-subagents shebang item). See docs/validation/m1.md.
- MCP management (connect/list-tools/status) lives in main (`src/main/mcp*.ts`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`), NOT the adapter — the adapter's OAuth is hard-gated on `ctx.hasUI` (no-op in RPC), and its structured headless actions are tool-only (no tool-exec verb in Pi RPC, so neither main nor the bridge can call them). Main and adapter share only the on-disk token store `<agentDir>/mcp-oauth/sha256-<sha256hex(serverName)>/tokens.json` (AuthEntry). A non-blocking startup sweep probes all configured servers; Phase 2 adds OAuth + add-time confirm.

## Docs workflow
Locked product decisions go to BOTH the Notion PRD and docs/prd.md in the same session,
folded in place with the "Decision (…)" convention. Never rewrite user-authored documents wholesale.
