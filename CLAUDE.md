# HappyVibe — project context

Electron app shipping a curated distribution of the Pi coding agent (pinned, vendored)
with permission UX + context-window visibility as the differentiators.
PRD: docs/prd.md (mirror of the Notion PRD — fold decisions in place, NEVER rewrite wholesale).

## Commands
- `npm install && (cd pi-runtime && npm ci)` — BOTH installs required (pi-runtime is a separate vendored tree; fresh worktrees fail live tests without it)
- `npm run dev` · `npm test` · `npm run build`
- Typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.node.json` and `-p tsconfig.web.json`
- Full gate = both typechecks + non-live suite + live files batched + build

## Tests
- Live-Pi tests (real DeepSeek; `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `.env`, skipIf-gated):
  tests/{bridge,rules-bridge,intent-bridge,ask-user-bridge,agents-md-bridge,subagent-context,subagent-async-bridge,subagent-discovery-bridge,permission-coexistence,mcp-bridge,plan-bridge}.test.ts
- Run live files BATCHED in one vitest invocation — they flake under the full parallel
  suite (process + LLM contention). One live failure ⇒ rerun in isolation before calling it a regression.
- Contract tests are the Pi upgrade gate: any pi/pi-subagents pin bump must pass them.
  Wire shapes are documented in docs/validation/d1.md — new bridge shapes go there too.

## Architecture (keep layer)
- src/main/pi/{spawn,codec,PiClient}.ts — spawns the pinned Pi CLI per session, `--mode rpc`,
  NDJSON over stdio. spawn.ts is electron-free (vitest-importable). We deliberately do NOT
  use Pi's in-process SDK: process isolation is load-bearing (crash isolation, hibernation).
- pi-runtime/ — vendored @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent + pi-subagents + pi-mcp-adapter (pinned exact)
  + extensions/ (happyvibe-bridge.ts + pure hv-*.ts modules shared with main and tests).
- The bridge owns ALL permission UI/enforcement (Pi's permission pkg is TUI-only in RPC —
  docs/validation/v6.md). Permission prompts never time out. They never auto-allow EXCEPT when
  a full bypass is active: session-only dangerous mode (`/hv-dangerous`) OR the persistent
  "Bypass ALL permissions" setting (global+workspace, workspace overrides global, resolved at
  spawn via `HV_BYPASS`; PRD §10 round-3 reversal). Bypass still audit-flags every call and
  shows the red banner.
- Bridge⇄main protocol: JSON envelopes `kind:"hv.*"` over extension_ui_request
  (blocking = select/input; fire-and-forget = notify); bridge slash-commands `/hv-*` via RPC prompt.
- JSONL EventLog, frozen envelope `{ts,type,sessionId?,workspaceId?,data?}` — audit + analytics. No SQLite.
- Model resolution: session → workspace → global, mirrored in ipc.ts `spawnOpts` AND
  renderer composer.ts `resolveModel` — change both or neither.

## Gotchas
- One-shot pi CLI calls hang unless stdin is closed (`stdio: ["ignore", …]`). RPC mode unaffected.
- macOS Dock icons: Electron-as-node children spawned from the main Electron binary each get a
  generic "exec" Dock icon (LaunchServices registers any .app-bundled binary as Foreground, even
  with ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE). All Pi child spawns must use `nodeExecPath()` (spawn.ts) — routes
  through `<Bundle> Helper (Plugin).app` (LSUIElement=1) — never raw `process.execPath`.
- Built-in Pi tools cannot take extra schema params (stripped before tool_call) — `intent`
  goes on registered tools only; built-ins get derived labels (toolLabel.ts / describeCommand.ts).
- Pi has NO dequeue RPC; abort preserves the queue.
- Context removal: completed turns only (removing the in-flight pair causes a runaway
  re-execution loop); toolCall/toolResult always removed atomically.
- `contextUsage.tokens` is null right after compaction; `stats.tokens` is cumulative-since-
  session-start — never present it as live context (gauge shows "measuring…").
- pi-subagents children need `PI_SUBAGENT_PI_BINARY` (set in spawn.ts) — it points at
  `pi-runtime/bin/pi-node.sh`, which routes through the bundled Electron helper
  (ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE) when packaged and falls back to `node` in dev. No system Node required.
- Async subagents (PRD §12): delegations are async-by-default (`writeSubagentConfig` in
  config.ts writes `asyncByDefault` at startup). Detached runs are `unref`'d — they SURVIVE a
  parent respawn, but pi-subagents drops their completion unless the resumed session keeps the
  SAME Pi session id, so ALWAYS resume via the session file (`startClient(meta,true)`). An active
  async run must keep the session non-idle (`activity.asyncRuns`, gated in `isIdle`) or
  hibernation/MCP-reload would `manager.stop()` mid-run. Lifecycle is relayed off pi-subagents'
  in-process `pi.events` bus by the bridge as `hv.subagent` notifies (never on RPC stdout);
  `/hv-subagent-list` resyncs cards after a respawn (restoreActiveJobs does NOT re-emit started).
- Every fs writer must be path-confined (pattern: agentsMd.ts / files.ts `resolveInWorkspace`).
- Workspace paths are normalized inside WorkspaceRegistry — never compare raw path strings.
- Renderer perf invariants: streaming text stays OUT of the transcripts array
  (streamRef + rAF batching in App.tsx); tool cards update via the toolIndex map, never a full .map().
- MCP: the adapter's proxy tool is `mcp`; the bridge unwraps it (hv-mcp.ts) to a virtual rule name `mcp:<serverKey>_<toolName>` (e.g. `mcp:github_create_issue`) for rules/grants/prompts/audit; discovery calls (search/describe/connect) are safe-default-allowed. Config is read at spawn; changes are applied live by respawning affected sessions (see MCP live-reload below). stdio servers configured with `node`/`npx` need a runtime in the packaged app (same class as the pi-subagents shebang item). See docs/validation/m1.md.
- MCP management (connect/list-tools/status) lives in main (`src/main/mcp*.ts`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`), NOT the adapter — the adapter's OAuth is hard-gated on `ctx.hasUI` (no-op in RPC), and its structured headless actions are tool-only (no tool-exec verb in Pi RPC, so neither main nor the bridge can call them). Main and adapter share only the on-disk token store `<agentDir>/mcp-oauth/sha256-<sha256hex(serverName)>/tokens.json` (AuthEntry). A non-blocking startup sweep probes all configured servers.
- MCP OAuth is host-driven in main (`src/main/mcpOAuth.ts`): `OAuthClientProvider` + loopback callback + `shell.openExternal` + `state` CSRF check + `transport.finishAuth` + fresh transport reconnect. Tokens written as `AuthEntry` (stamped `serverUrl`) so the adapter reads them at runtime. IPC: `hv:mcp-authenticate` / `hv:mcp-logout`. Add-time confirm-with-tools modal; per-server Authenticate / Log out; startup status sweep. Contract test `tests/mcp-adapter-authformat.test.ts` must pass on any pi-mcp-adapter pin bump. See docs/validation/m1.md.
- MCP intent: `mcp` is in `INTENT_TOOLS` (happyvibe-bridge.ts) — `requireIntent` injects a required `intent` into the adapter's proxy schema, so the model authors a customer-facing headline per MCP call (toolLabel.ts mcp case = `intent ?? unwrapMcpCall().display`). Proxy mode: the proxy `execute` ignores the top-level intent (not forwarded to the server). DIRECT MODE: the direct executor forwards params VERBATIM, so `requireIntent` also injects intent into every adapter-registered direct tool (`sourceInfo.path` contains pi-mcp-adapter) and the bridge's `tool_call` handler STRIPS `input.intent` for those tools before anything reads input (Pi's mutable-input hook; `strippedIntentTools` set). UI still sees intent — `tool_execution_start` fires with original args BEFORE tool_call handlers. Server tools with their own `intent` param: no injection, no strip. The permission prompt uses the FACTUAL `unwrapMcpCall().display` (now enriched with a key arg like url/query), NOT the model's intent (safety). `unwrapMcpCall` is the single source for that factual display (gate + renderer). Unit contract: tests/intent-direct-tools.test.ts.
- MCP live-reload: Pi/the adapter read MCP config only at spawn (no live tool-reload API). So `hv:mcp-set-server`/`hv:mcp-authenticate`/`hv:mcp-logout` call `scheduleMcpReload` (debounced, coalesces add+auth) → respawn affected live sessions RESUMED (`startClient(meta,true)` — the hibernation path; conversation preserved via the session file). Scope: global change → all live sessions, workspace change → that workspace's (`affectedSessionIds`, `mcpReloadScope.ts`). Only IDLE sessions (`activity.isIdle`) reload immediately; busy ones defer via `pendingMcpReload`, drained on `agent_end` / permission-prompt close. A respawn RESETS that session's in-memory `sessionGrants` + dangerous mode to safe defaults (`hv:session-reloading` → renderer notice). After respawn, main fires `/hv-tools` to refresh the displayed tool list.

- Plan Mode (§23, `hv-plan.ts` + bridge + `src/main/plans.ts`): per-session read-only mode. The
  `gatePlanCall` clamp runs in the tool_call handler BEFORE the dangerous/bypass check and the rule
  engine — plan mode wins over bypass. plan_complete/plan_start/plan_status_update are in `SAFE_TOOLS`
  (hv-rules.ts) so they never raise a permission prompt (they're app-internal control tools, not
  side effects) — forgetting this makes plan_complete hang on a permission modal that auto-denies.
  The plan is a workspace file `.agents/plans/NNN-slug.md` written by MAIN (path-confined, numbering
  serialized) — the bridge only gets the path back via the BLOCKING hv.plan-write input round-trip
  (main must ALWAYS respondUi, error string on failure, else the bridge hangs). Plan state
  `{enabled,planPath}` persists via appendEntry and is restored + re-emitted (hv.plan notify) on
  session_start — SURVIVES respawn, unlike dangerous mode. `.agents` is in files.ts DOTFILE_ALLOW so
  plans show in the tree + the watcher pushes hv:plan-changed for live n/m checklist progress. Implement/
  exit/reopen are human-only IPC (no plan_off tool) — the security invariant.

## Docs workflow
Locked product decisions go to BOTH the Notion PRD and docs/prd.md in the same session,
folded in place with the "Decision (…)" convention. Never rewrite user-authored documents wholesale.
